I am an attorney and an advocate for neighborhoods in Baltimore City, where I've lived for five years. I own a fixer upper on the north side of the city, near Loyola University, where my spouse teaches philosophy. I am a neglectful gardener and a timid cyclist.

## Environmental Justice

I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, a small post-industrial city, in the same working class neighborhood where my grandparents and father grew up. The city's southeast side is filled with struggling and shuttered tool and die factories. As I walked to my bus stop in the morning as a child, the burning chemical smells of grinding and shaving metal bloomed out of the open windows of the factory buildings.

I discovered the concept of environmental injustice as a sociology undergraduate, and I immediately recognized my own community in its description. After I graduated from college, as I flipped through an issue of Orion magazine, the following paragraph from [Sandra Steingraber's essay, titled *Environmental Amnesia*](https://orionmagazine.org/article/environmental-amnesia/) jolted me:

>"I was recently invited to Rockford, Illinois, to speak about toxic chemicals. That seemed appropriate because Rockford is the site of a longstanding Superfund site. Solvents used by former businesses had drizzled into drinking water wells. Rockford is famous within toxicology circles because of the bladder-cancer cluster that was discovered here and because it was here where researchers figured out, in the 1980s, that the level of solvents in human blood is predicted not by the amount of water drunk from the tap but by the length of “shower run times.” In other words, inhalation is a bigger route of exposure to solvent-contaminated drinking water than drinking it, and showering provides the biggest dose. And yet only two people in my college audience knew about these studies — or even knew that Rockford had a Superfund site. Even the local emergency-room physician hadn’t heard the news."

Even as someone who had studied environmental injustice and who had grown up within one mile of the Superfund site, I had had no idea about my hometown's fame (infamy?) among toxicologists.

## Legal Career

After a year serving through the Americorps*VISTA program at an environmental organization in Boston, I studied mostly environmental and public health law. I graduated from Boston University School of Law in 2011.

Post-graduation, I was a **Legal Fellow at the California state Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)**. As a fellow, I drafted stern letters to retail stores that bought cheap children's jewelry in bulk from China which was filled with lead. I combed through the deeds of property that was originally polluted by an ancestor of Pacific Gas and Electric, over a century beforehand.

Following my academic spouse to Baltimore, I then began a Staff Attorney position at [Community Law Center](www.communitylaw.org). For my first two years at CLC, I ran its Pro Bono Program, tracking the intake of cases and matching them with outside volunteer counsel.

In 2013, I took on a project called *[Booze News](www.communitylaw.org/booze-news/)*, in which I attended every hearing at the Baltimore City Liquor Board and wrote a post about what I saw. Over the four years of Booze News, there were four different sets of commissioners and four very different philosophies about how to regulate alcohol in Baltimore City in order to protect the public's health and safety. In 2014-15, the commissioners appointed by the governor were so unwilling to fulfill the agency's mission that the careful documentation of their failures in the blog mobilized community members [to oppose successfully the commissioners' confirmation by the Maryland State Senate](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-senate-committee-votes-against-baltimore-liquor-board-members-20160321-story.html).

As an attorney for small nonprofits, besides my Liquor Board-related work, I review and revise policies and bylaws, negotiate contracts, and mediate disputes.
