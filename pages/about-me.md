I am an attorney and an advocate for neighborhoods in Baltimore City. I own a fixer upper on the north side of the city, near Loyola University, where my spouse teaches philosophy. I am a neglectful gardener and a timid cyclist.

# Environmental Justice

I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, a small post-industrial city, in the same working class neighborhood where my grandparents and father grew up. The city's southeast side is filled with struggling and shuttered tool and die factories.

When I first heard the concept of environmental injustice as a sociology undergraduate, I immediately recognized my own community. A few years later, as I flipped through an issue of *Orion* magazine one day, the following paragraph from [Sandra Steingraber's essay, titled *Environmental Amnesia*](https://orionmagazine.org/article/environmental-amnesia/) jolted me:

>"I was recently invited to Rockford, Illinois, to speak about toxic chemicals. That seemed appropriate because Rockford is the site of a longstanding Superfund site. Solvents used by former businesses had drizzled into drinking water wells. Rockford is famous within toxicology circles because of the bladder-cancer cluster that was discovered here and because it was here where researchers figured out, in the 1980s, that the level of solvents in human blood is predicted not by the amount of water drunk from the tap but by the length of “shower run times.” In other words, inhalation is a bigger route of exposure to solvent-contaminated drinking water than drinking it, and showering provides the biggest dose. And yet only two people in my college audience knew about these studies — or even knew that Rockford had a Superfund site. Even the local emergency-room physician hadn’t heard the news."

Even as someone who had grown up within one mile of the Superfund site, I had had no clue about my hometown's fame (infamy?) among toxicologists.

# Legal Career

After I graduated from Boston University School of Law, having focused my elective coursework mostly on environmental law and policy, I was a **Legal Fellow at the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)**. As a fellow, I drafted stern letters to retail stores that sold cheap bulk children's jewelry shipped from China and filled with lead. I combed through the deeds of a property originally polluted in the late 1800s by a corporate predecessor of Pacific Gas and Electric. I enjoyed doing work that protected the citizens of California from the proven harmful effects of toxic substances.

Following my academic spouse to Baltimore, I began a Staff Attorney position at [Community Law Center](http://www.communitylaw.org) in 2012. For my first two years at CLC, I ran its Pro Bono Program, tracking the intake of cases and matching them with outside volunteer counsel.

In 2013, I took on a project called *[Booze News](http://www.communitylaw.org/booze-news/)*, in which I attended every hearing at the Baltimore City Liquor Board and wrote a post about what I witnessed. Over the four years of Booze News, the Liquor Board went through four different sets of commissioners and four very different philosophies about how to regulate alcohol in Baltimore City. In 2014-15, the commissioners appointed by the governor were so unwilling to fulfill the agency's mission that the careful documentation of their failures in the blog mobilized community members [to oppose successfully the commissioners' confirmation by the Maryland State Senate](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-senate-committee-votes-against-baltimore-liquor-board-members-20160321-story.html).

As an attorney for small nonprofits, besides my Liquor Board-related work, I review and revise policies and bylaws, negotiate contracts, and mediate disputes.
