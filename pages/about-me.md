I am an attorney and an advocate for neighborhoods in Baltimore City, where I've lived for five years. I own a shabby bungalow on the north side of the city, near Loyola University, where my husband teaches philosophy. I am a neglectful gardener and a timid cyclist.

## Environmental Justice

I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, a small post-industrial city, in the same working class neighborhood where my grandparents and father grew up. The city's southeast side is filled with struggling and shuttered tool and die factories. As I walked to my bus stop in the morning as a child, the burning chemical smells of grinding and shaving metal bloomed out of the open windows of the factory buildings.

I discovered the concept of environmental injustice as a sociology undergraduate, and I immediately recognized my own community in its description. After I graduated from college, as I flipped through an issue of Orion magazine, the following paragraph from [Sandra Steingraber's essay, titled *Environmental Amnesia*](https://orionmagazine.org/article/environmental-amnesia/) jolted me:

>"I was recently invited to Rockford, Illinois, to speak about toxic chemicals. That seemed appropriate because Rockford is the site of a longstanding Superfund site. Solvents used by former businesses had drizzled into drinking water wells. Rockford is famous within toxicology circles because of the bladder-cancer cluster that was discovered here and because it was here where researchers figured out, in the 1980s, that the level of solvents in human blood is predicted not by the amount of water drunk from the tap but by the length of “shower run times.” In other words, inhalation is a bigger route of exposure to solvent-contaminated drinking water than drinking it, and showering provides the biggest dose. And yet only two people in my college audience knew about these studies — or even knew that Rockford had a Superfund site. Even the local emergency-room physician hadn’t heard the news.""

Even as someone who had been exposed to the idea of environmental injustice and who had grown up less than a mile from the Superfund site, I had had no idea about my hometown's fame (infamy?) among toxicologists.

## Legal Career

After a year serving through the Americorps*VISTA program at an environmental organization in Boston, I graduated from Boston University School of Law in 2011.

Post-graduation, I worked for several months as a Legal Fellow in Sacramento, at the California state Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), a division of the state's environmental protection agency. I
